__Project name__

The project name is : **Sport Event App**

__Purpose__

 the purpose of this app is to deliver a one of a kind platform that will unite between a fan for a specific sport and the event that will be published from the event holder, so they can interact with each other in a simple way without the noise of having to go for another platform that will charge them for extra money to publish their event, and make it easier for the fan-side to find all the events that shall interest them in one place and for different teams.

Cross platform was a vital point that is requested from the user so they won't have technical problems as the users will operate from different operating systems. The intention for the base is to be build on flutter framework that is codded in Dart and both of them are built by google.

# Intended audience

Intended to be used by anyone who wants to register for a web application account.it can be student , teachers ,tourist or whoever,as long as they register and login ,they can have the total access in this website,there is no other limit of it.
Is to deliver a top-notch project that will get the user what events they search for and be good competitor on the market with other applications. Starting from the user logging on the application to browsing the events then choosing the one they want to go for then getting the ticket and be ready to go.

__User Needs__

To use this web page, user needs to find the web page in any browser by using the name of the page, then the user can see the front of the web page which has a sign up and log in place so in order to register the user need to fill out his/her username which is email and enter password

__System rules, patterns, recommendations__

For this project we will use Flutter which is is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single code base so it will be useful for this project.
for every problem, we meet, we will try to find good solution for it, we will try to use good technology,
such as android studio.
For database we will use Firebase which is also platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications.
Dart will be the main language we use.

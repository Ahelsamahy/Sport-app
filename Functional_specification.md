## 1. Overview

As it was requested from the client, the purpose of this app is to deliver a one of a kind platform that will unite between a fan for a specific sport and the event that will be published from the event holder, so they can interact with each other in a simple way without the noise of having to go for another platform that will charge them for extra money to publish their event, and make it easier for the fan-side to find all the events that shall interest them in one place and for different teams.

Cross platform was a vital point that is requested from the user so they won't have technical problems as the users will operate from different operating systems. The intention for the base is to be build on flutter framework that is codded in Dart and both of them are built by google.

## 2. Current state

At this moment, we are a small team that consists of 5 junior developer with 1 senior developer to authorize over our progress and make sure that we follow the guidelines to deliver a project that will be new in the market.

Our aim for this project is to start learning the way for framework to work as it will be our first approach to it but it will be a keystone in the project to satisfy the client request in making it cross platform
